  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
   Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources of the future. In this project, we explore how solar energy harnesses the power of the sun through the principles of physics, while focusing on smart applications like solar panels, energy storage, and sustainable solutions. From understanding the fundamental processes to exploring the cutting-edge technologies, this project aims to provide insights into how solar energy can shape a greener, smarter future.

    <h2>How AI Transformed My Teaching</h2>
    <p>AI has quietly become my teaching companion. What once felt like a buzzword now feels like a helping hand—offering tools that save time, spark creativity, and keep students curious. I’ve used AI to generate quick explanations, design interactive lessons, and even predict where a student might be struggling. It’s like having a silent co-teacher who never gets tired. Personally, it’s made learning exciting again—there’s always something new to try, explore, or improve. AI hasn’t made teaching easier, but it’s definitely made it smarter and more connected to the needs of today’s learners—and mine too.</p>
